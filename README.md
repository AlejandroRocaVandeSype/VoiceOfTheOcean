# Voice Of The Ocean (WIP)
Game based on mechanics using the player’s voice. The player will sing and create melodies that will have different effects in the world.

In the adventure you’ll be a new-born mermaid, the last one of your kind. You´ll discover the powers of your voice while you find out what happened to your lost civilization. By using the microphone, you will sing melodies and chords. The player will have to solve enigmas and imitate sounds with their own voice.

Those melodies will create effects in the game, like making a puffer fish follow you, push him away or activating the architecture of the mermaids.

This project is currently in development as we are working on it during our last school year. We plan to finish it by the end of the year.
